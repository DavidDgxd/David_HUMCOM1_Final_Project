**Deelan David: Academic E-Portfolio**
This repository contains the complete static website (HTML and CSS) serving as my academic e-portfolio for the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Web Development courses taken during my first year of Computer Science at the University of Baguio.

The portfolio is designed with a distinctive, dark-themed interface to showcase my learning journey, organized by academic activities, major project milestones, and professional development achievements.

Portfolio Sections and Content Focus
The portfolio is structured into clear sections to guide the viewer through my academic work:

**Introduction:** 
Provides a brief personal profile, including my school, course, and year level.


**E-Portfolio: Academic Activities:**
Laboratory Activities: Contains a chronological showcase of hands-on coding and development tasks across First, Midterm, and Final grading periods (focusing on basic HTML, formatting, Git, forms, and introductory CSS).

HCI Activities (Individual & Group): Features assignments that apply key Human-Computer Interaction concepts, such as analyzing affordance, conducting heuristic evaluations, and designing for accessibility.

**Certifications & Achievements: **
Displays professional and academic certificates of completion and participation (e.g., Cisco Cybersecurity, DevFest Baguio).

**Reflection:** 
Human-Computer Interaction: A personal essay detailing my conceptual understanding and major takeaways from the HCI course, focusing on principles like affordance, accessibility, and the importance of a user-centric design mindset.

**Key Technologies & Concepts Demonstrated**
**Structure and Styling:** 
Built using clean HTML5 for semantic structure and CSS3 for all styling, layout, and responsive design, utilizing custom CSS variables for easy theme management.

**Design Implementation:** 
Features a fully responsive layout optimized for various screen sizes.

**User Interface:** 
Uses pure CSS Modals (powered by the :target pseudo-class) to provide detailed information about each activity without relying on complex JavaScript.

**Core Skills Applied:** 
Practical application of web fundamentals, version control principles (Git), UI/UX planning (Figma mockups), and theoretical HCI principles in design evaluation.

**Repository Structure**
The core files reside at the root, with an assets folder for all media:

**Final.html:** The main structural document containing all content and project modal definitions.

**Final style.css:** The complete, consolidated stylesheet for all visual elements and responsive rules.

**assets/:** A folder containing all referenced image assets (profile picture, activity screenshots, certificates, and mockups).
